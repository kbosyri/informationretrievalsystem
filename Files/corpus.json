Secondly, SODA IS ATTRACTIVE, and according to a few medical experts it's even addictive (yes, caffeine is addictive to some extent).  . . Secondly the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drinks.  For example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place, you would probably & naturally  be drinking more water rather than if you are from   a country like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland.. . Another reason is that people being less immune to impure water (like tap water) and being more dependent on bottled water makes the water less affordable and less available.  If you need to pay  extra or need to work harder to get the commodity, you may resort to cheaper commodity or a near by commodity.. . Another reason I also feel is the commute using Cars rather than walking or cycling.

In many other countries people walk, walk and walk for several small things.. . Lack of education and awareness is also a reason for not consuming enough water. Not many people (except for few educated ones)know that 80% of our body is water.  Even if they knew, ppl forget that fact easily and resort to \"other drinks\".. .

The result of not treating it swiftly can be deafness for the cat.. . I got my cat from a friend of a friend who owned a farm.  She was born there and probably spent a lot of time in the barn and outdoors in general. When I got her she had this black gunk in both her ears.. . I took her to the vet almost as soon as I got her, so I could get her shots and get her registered, checked out, and her checked out and find out anything I should know as a cat owner.  She was the first cat I had ever owned.. . He said the black stuff was ear mites and gave me some stuff for that.  I dutifully put that on her on my back patio in the mornings according to the directions that came with it.  The result was her ears got clean and stayed that way forever.  She suffered no loss of hearing as far as I can tell.  She comes when I call her name, just like a dog, in fact!. . My mom had a cat which she got from a shelter.  Eventually it passed on to my brother.  Before, it had been an indoor cat.  My brother decided it should be an outdoor cat.  At some point, the cat must have gotten ear mites.  Not sure if this was before anyone in our family had it or afterwards.  Whichever it was, the mite infestation must not have been caught and treated in time.  . . The cat is quite deaf.  It never responds when being called, even to look, when you are right there in the room with it.  It does not respond to loud noises at all, either.. . I know the annual checkups you take your cat to the vet for are kind of expensive but a big portion of that is for the shots, some of which they do not need every year anyway.  For example, my cat gets a 3 year rabies shot - so it does not need one every year.  So most years, the annual visit to vet is not as expensive as that one.. . If you are sure that the condition is caused by ear mites and you cannot afford to take the cat to the vet right now, at least get the medicine right away and apply it as directed.  I just looked, and PetSmart carries it.  There is probably a PetSmart near you and if not, it looks like you can order it from their web site.  It only costs $10.49 today.. . According to the second Source I have listed (kittencare.com) the mites could have moved from your cat to your house.  It sounds like they might move back again.  You might want to be on guard for that.. . I really encourage you to talk to a vet.. . Like I said, though both my cat and my brother's/mother's cat had the same condition - my cat has perfect hearing and the other cat is completely deaf.  The only difference was in the treatment they received.. . If you must skip the visit to the vet, or delay it, do not delay treating the ear mites at all!  Get the medicine for it and carefully use it as directed.. . Make sure you apply the miticide outside and make sure you dispose of whatever you apply it to your cats ears with outside as well.  Do not bring it back in your house to throw it away.  Do not wipe your cats ears inside. You might wipe the mites onto your floor and you really want to keep them outside.. . I am including a couple more links just so you will have more sources of information at your fingertips.  Might as well do all your research at once so you can act right away, without second thoughts or wishing you had more information.. . Good luck with the treatment and I hope your kitty gets well!. . The first step is spotting the mites and recognizing what they are, not just thinking it is dirt.. . You have done that, so now all that is left is the treatment and it is not hard to do.. . Make sure you hold your cat's head perfectly still while you apply the stuff.  Do not go in too far, either.. . She should be fine if you have caught the problem in time.", "3228020_4": "You could start with a simple ear cleaning--use warm olive/cooking oil.

As v gets larger(it can never be the speed of light, then the denomonator would be zero) that fraction becomes closer to 1, so when you subtract it from one, the denomonator gets smaller and smaller, meaning t gets smaller(in order for t' to remain constant) this means that time slows down for the object moving at such velocities!

Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: \"the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions.\" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a \"quick test\" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . .

This sort of depends on the bike...2 strokes are a little different than 4 strokes and I will address those separately.. . The key to break in on new motors is heat cycles.  New motors are not built with crappy tolerancing like older motors so your main concern is seating the rings properly.  This is done by putting the motor through a few heat cycles.  In race applications and when facilities are available, you would run the engine up to operating temperature and go full throttle through all gears then let it cool down completely.  This process would be done a few times.  The point is to put complete load on the engine when at proper operating temperature.  Remember, this is typical only for 'race' applications.. . For most normal users, you just ride it below the suggested rpm limit for a certain amount of mileage.  The theory is that this works similarly to the above.  You don't overstress the motor and you put an appropriate load on it.  It is good to vary the rpm during break-in.. . For two-strokes, you need to run a much more oil-rich mixture for proper lubrication.  After the suggested mileage, you can then switch the mixture to the normal ratio.. . Definitely, the owners manual will give you the 'recommended' method.  There is a lot of available data on why you break in motors in certain ways and why you don't.

It would determine if the US would be an agricultural, or a industrial nation.. . As an interesting note, Southern lawmakers wanted the slave population counted for representation and have voting rights, in an effort to secure their domination over the government.  The Northern didnt want that, for same reason.  This is where the idea that every 3 slaves counted as 2 people for the purpose of representation.  Eventually this wasnt enough, and civil war was fought.. . Why was the emancipation proclomation made?  To be able to free the slave population to fight for northern interests.. . . So what then, did we get out of the civil war?. . 1. The beginnings of true freedom for all races. 2. a house of representatives, and the senate. 3. a nation that is a mix of agricultural and industrial.. . Instead of concentrating on the issue of slavery, which existed before the war, we should concentrate on what the civil war taught us, and the good that came from it.. . it comes down to this...

Please be prepared for. the role of responsible dog ownership before taking the step and buying a puppy, or adopting a dog. Unfortunately, many people put more thought into buying a car, or a major household appliance than they do when considering adding a dog to their home.. A dog will be in your home for a long time. A dog is not an item, or a piece of furniture,   it is a family member you are adding. Please do not take this responsibility lightly. Unfortunately, we have come to live in a time of 'disposable' dogs, and people do not think twice before dumping, or abandoning an animal.  Be prepared for the role of RESPONSIBLE dog owner, and do not be a part of the problem.. . .  . Be Prepared for:.  . A few sleepless nights ignoring howling, crying & barking, until your puppy learns that this is his new home. . A lot of Carpet Cleaning, and wet spots. Puppies DO have accidents!! . A few damaged items around the house. Puppies DO chew, and are bound to damage/destroy at least one thing they were not supposed to have! . Babyproofing your home! Like a toddler, puppies find things that can hurt them!. You will need to hide wires, and keep potentially dangerous items like chocolates,. and cleaners out of reach. Adding a puppy is like bringing home a toddler, you MUST be prepared!!!! . Constant supervision. If you can't watch your puppy, crate your puppy. A crate is NOT a prison. It is more like a 'playpen'. Would you let your toddler stay home alone, or wander the house unattended?? . Boxer puppies can be particularly good at testing your patience. These are rambunctious, bold puppies who can be hard to tire out!! Some seem to be on the go CONSTANTLY. .  . . Also remember.......  . Puppies are much like babies. They need lots of interaction. If someone will not be at home most of the day, a puppy may be a poor choice for your family. . Puppies need to be taken outside many times during the day to reinforce housebreaking. You cannot blame a puppy for pottying in the house, if he/she isn't given enough chances to 'go' outside.  Adult dogs have better bladder control than puppies and can be expected to 'hold it' a bit longer, and are more capable of learning how to 'tell you' they have to go out! . Puppies need to be taught what is appropriate to chew on, and what is NOT an appropriate toy! Don't give your puppy an old shoe and then expect them to know the difference between the old shoes and your new pair of $80 tennis shoes. . Puppies need to be trained. Your puppy needs your time, and your patience to learn how they are supposed to behave. With no socialization or training, your puppy may NOT grow up to be an ideal companion. This is NOT the dogs fault, but more so, the owners for not socializing or training the dog when it was young. . Do you and your puppy a favor. LEARN about training, and ask your breeder for help if needed.

Pay Yourself First. Just as you pay companies for products and services, so you should pay yourself but before you pay anyone else.  In other words, as the poster above recommended, put some of your salary immediately (automatically if possible) into a savings account.  The advantage is that after a while you won't notice the drop in spending money and you'll feel so good as your pile of money grows.  Talking of which.... . 2. Make your money work for you. As you know, interest accrues on savings in a bank and after a while, interest will accrue on the interest you've already earned.  This is called compound interest and is extremely powerful but needs time to work.  Like a car rolling down a hill, it starts off slowly but eventually builds up speed.  More than anything, this is what is most likely to make you rich over time.  On the other hand, it can ruin you if you go into debt when compound interest works against you and you are charged interest on the interest of your original debt.. . So, live within your means, make it a priority to save or invest (sensibly) every month and allow your interest to gain interest on itself.

This article did not include people who are famous or got their wealth through big entertainment contracts or anything like that....it just reported on regular people that made millions and how they did it.  So this is what it said.. . They lived within their means.  When they began working, they budgeted their money and never spent more than they earned.  For example, they bought a car, kept the oil changed and all that regular check up stuff, and kept the car for as long as it was a financial asset.  They bought clothes, only what they needed, and kept those clothes until they no longer served the purpose they were bought for (ripped up, torn, stained beyond repair, etc...)  They bought a house, with land if able, and kept it.  Basically, they worked hard, spent ONLY what was neccessary to live, and saved the rest.  They didn't buy things because they could, they saved instead.  Almost none of them owned a nice car or an expensive t.v. or a big, lavish home.  They all looked like regular people, clothes bought mostly from thrift stores or WalMart, t.v.'s under 25\" (and no plasma or flat screen either).  They bought food every week to cook at home (take out is too expensive in the long run).  They didn't have hundreds of CD's and DVD's and didn't have the high end stereo's or surround sounds.  They worked smarter than everyone else, saving when others would spend.  They weren't alcoholics or druggies.  They got good jobs with companies that offered good benefits and saved themselves for retirement.  They kept working until they were unable to anymore (and that was very few, believe it or not).  When they couldn't work outside the home anymore, they worked at home.  They took care of themselves and didn't do it by buying memberships to gyms or weight loss programs.  They did it the old fashioned way.. . So the end result is that over years and years, all the pennies they saved truly did add up to millions.  Smart spending is what did it for them, and saving everything possible is what got them where they are.  They are all normal people who did what most people find impossible, they worked for it.

Because gasoline includes hydrocarbon molecules the fuel provides carbon and hydrogen for combustion and the products of combustiuon are carbon dioxide (and dangerous carbon monoxide with too little air present) plus H2O or water.  A gallon of gas produces about a gallon of water (which you can see as steam out the car's tailpipe on a very cold day).. .

Materials such as glass, fur and cloth acquire and electric charge by rubbing them egains each other, a process which tears electrons off one substance and attaches it to the other. Electric charges (+) and (-) may also be separated by a chemical process, as in an electric battery.. . Electric Charge. The unit of electric charge is the coulomb. Ordinary matter is made up of atoms which have positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons surrounding them. Charge is quantized as a multiple of the electron or proton charge: . . . . The influence of charges is characterized in terms of the forces between them (Coulomb's law) and the electric field and voltage produced by them. One coulomb of charge is the charge which would flow through a 120 watt lightbulb (120 volts AC) in one second. Two charges of one coulomb each separated by a meter would repel each other with a force of about a million tons!. . The rate of flow of electric charge is called electric current and is measured in amperes. . . In introducing one of the fundamental properties of matter, it is perhaps appropriate to point out that we use simplified sketches and constructs to introduce concepts, and there is inevitably much more to the story. No significance should be attached to the circles representing the proton and electron, in the sense of implying a relative size, or even that they are hard sphere objects, although that's a useful first construct. The most important opening idea, electrically, is that they have a property called \"charge\" which is the same size, but opposite in polarity for the proton and electron. The proton has 1836 times the mass of the electron, but exactly the same size charge, only positive rather than negative. Even the terms \"positive\" and \"negative\" are arbitrary, but well-entrenched historical labels. The essential implication of that is that the proton and electron will strongly attract each other, the historical archtype of the cliche \"opposites attract\". Two protons or two electrons would strongly repel each other. Once you have established those basic ideas about electricity, \"like charges repel and unlike charges attract\", then you have the foundation for electricity and can build from there.. . From the precise electrical neutrality of bulk matter as well as from detailed microscopic experiments, we know that the proton and electron have the same magnitude of charge. All charges observed in nature are multiples of these fundamental charges. Although the standard model of the proton depicts it as being made up of fractionally charged particles called quarks, those fractional charges are not observed in isolation -- always in combinations which produce +/- the electron charge.. . An isolated single charge can be called an \"electric monopole\". Equal positive and negative charges placed close to each other constitute an electric dipole. Two oppositely directed dipoles close to each other are called an electric quadrupole. You can continue this process to any number of poles, but dipoles and quadrupoles are mentioned here because they find significant application in physical phenomena. . . One of the fundamental symmetries of nature is the conservation of electric charge. No known physical process produces a net change in electric charge", "4120905_3": "Electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interactions.", "4120905_4": "Electric charge is a fundamental conserved property of some subatomic particles, which determines their electromagnetic interactions.

This year\u2019s visit of the Dalai Lama to Portland brought about renewed discussion, especially with young people, of peace and how to achieve it. The Dalai Lama\u2019s commitment to non-violence and compassion is an ideal that more and more Americans are inspired by. . How can we help our children practice these qualities and begin to experience: compassion and understanding - rather than blame; forgiveness \u00ad rather than retaliation; active calm - rather than anger or passive victim-consciousness?. . Of course, the first and best way to teach anything is to model it yourself. When someone cuts in front of you in traffic or honks at you if you hesitate, do you mutter an epithet or react with fear? Or do you cheerfully say, \u201cGo ahead, I hope you make it safely!\u201d Can you perhaps comment with compassion to your child, \u201cImagine being so tense and unhappy.\u201d. . Understanding that 1) that the impatience and anger of others is coming from their own lack of inner peace, and 2) that theirs is a vortex of blaming, negative energy that you can enter or not, by your own choice, is a huge step toward living in peace and non-violence. It may be asking too much of most children that they see this when the negativity is coming from another child toward them personally. Yet if they live in a home where the parent has modeled this understanding when tested through neighbors, co-workers, and even their own family members, they eventually gain the maturity to see this truth in their own lives.. . When I was a classroom teacher I had many opportunities to observe the difference it makes when a family supports this point of view of conflict. I have had students who had a disagreement outside the classroom where the parents took their own child\u2019s side with no attempt to understand or forgive the other child\u2019s shortcomings. . . In one incident, two students had a misunderstanding that spilled over into the parents\u2019 world. One parent, perhaps feeling inadequate and defensive, became angry. This family dealt with the situation with anger, blame, and feelings of insult and indignation. . . Of course their daughter stopped playing with or speaking to the other child. . . The other family, while supporting their daughter, discussed how their intentions could had been so misinterpreted and how to make the other family feel better. In the end, they realized the best thing to do was forgive and say nothing while keeping the family in their prayers.. .  The daughter of the first family often had emotional blocks at school, where she could not overcome disappointment or her own mistakes. The other girl was almost always happy and able to pick herself up after a mistake and try again. A couple of weeks later, I observed the daughter of the family who forgave, happily cheering the other girl on in a contest. She was well-adjusted and not living in the thought of their former disagreement at all. Whereas, the girl of the parents determined to be \u201cright\u201d lived in countless contractions of the heart where she could not let others in.. . Discussions about teaching children not to resort to violence often focus on teaching \u201cconflict resolution.\u201d Teaching conflict resolution is an excellent thing and helpful to students who find themselves embroiled in conflict. But I would like to see more attention given to changing the consciousness of children so that so many conflicts don\u2019t even arise. . .

Two things are required for evolution geographic isolation and environmental stress. To simplify it, a group of ancestral primates, let's call them proto-monkeys is living happily in the forest. They have no predators and have over populated the area to the point where there is not enough food to support the existing population. So rather than starve they spread out in search of food. Some are able to find food in the grasslands, they survive, but do not thrive; some do better than others. So find food in the mountains, they survive, but do not thrive; some do better than others. Those that do better than others have more mating oppertunities and pass their genes on to the next generation. Those that don't do so well, don't pass their genes on. Random mistakes are often made in DNA deplication, sometimes they are fatal, sometimes they give an advantage and sometime they don't make a difference. Because these mistakes are random they will vary in geographically isoloated populations. The plains monkeys have become taller because the shorter ones could not see predators over the grass and were all eaten and did not pass on their genes. The mountain monkeys have become hairy because those with less hair all froze to death and did not pass on their genes. But nothing has changed in the habitat of the original population of proto-monkeys. If there is no change to cause environmental stress a species will not change to try and balance out the stress. These 3 populations of proto-monkeys could interact, but they are happy where they are, and if there is no environmental stress there is no reason to leave your habitat.

Control of pain and the inflammatory process. .             Pain treatment should be initiated early and efficiently to gain control. Ice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and relative rest may help with controlling the pain and the inflammatory process. Excessive bedrest, however, may be detrimental by leading to lumbar segment motion, loss of muscle strength, and general deconditioning with blunting of motivation.. .          2. Restoration of joint ROM and soft-tissue extensibility. .             Extension exercises may reduce neural tension. Flexion exercises reduce articular weight-bearing stress to the facet joints and stretch the dorsolumbar fascia. The use of ultrasound may improve collagen extensibility.. .          3. Improvement of muscular strength and endurance. .             Exercise training can begin after the patient has passed successfully through the pain control phase. The key is to attain adequate musculoligamentous control of lumbar spine forces to minimize the risk of repetitive injury to the intervertebral discs, facet joints, and surrounding structures. Start with isometrics, then progress to isotonic exercises with effort directed at concentric strengthening.. .          4. Coordination retraining. .             Dynamic exercise in a structured training program maximizes coordinated muscle group activities that lead to postural control and the fusion of muscle control with spine stability.. .          5. Improvement of general cardiovascular condition. .             Patients are encouraged to remain active and initiate brisk walking programs, aquatic activities, or use of stationary bicycles/stair steppers. These activities can increase endorphin levels, promoting a sense of well-being, and allow the patient to perform at a higher level of function before perceiving pain.. .          6. Maintenance exercise programs. .             A home program is developed within the tolerance and ability of the patient in order to encourage continued exercise after discharge from physical therapy.. .       The main goal of physical therapy in acute back pain is not to increase strength, but to achieve adequate pain control. No benefit has been demonstrated for strengthening exercises in acute back pain. Exercise should begin with extension exercises in the prone position after lateral trunk shifts and then progress, as tolerated, to prone lying with support. Flexion exercises can be performed only if no acute dural tension exists.. .       The spine should be stabilized using strengthening of segmental muscles followed by the prime movers of the spine (latissimus dorsi, abdominals, erector spinae). Muscle groups should be strengthened in a neutral position to decrease tension on ligaments and joints; this position allows balanced segmental forces between the discs and the zygapophyseal joints and maximizes functional stability with axial loading.. .       Physical therapy programs also should include positioning the patient to maximize comfort. Loosening of the hamstrings, glutei, gastrocnemius/soleus group, tensor fascia latae, quadriceps group, and hip flexors also contributes to reduction of LBP and effective conditioning. . .

Great Scotland Yard still exists as a street today, and the building is used as stables for some of the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch.. . Sixteenth century maps of London show part of the land to the east of present day Whitehall as \"Scotland\" or \"Scotland Yard\".   This is linked to the royal palace, built by Cardinal Wolsey on land given to him in 1519, which once stood at the South end of Kinges Streate (ie modern Whitehall).   At one time the land was divided into Great Scotland Yard, Middle Scotland Yard and Little Scotland Yard.   Many of the buildings there were leased to private buildings or occupied by the Office of Works attached to the Palace of Whitehall.   At one time Sir Christopher Wren occupied apartments there.. . The land may originally have been given by the Saxon King Edgar to King Kenneth III of Scotland for accommodation for his annual journey \"to do homage for his kingdom of Scotland\" and then later used by the Scottish kings when they came to do homage, as barons of the realm, for the counties of Cumberland, Huntingdon and other English lands held by them.. . The Palace of Scotland was allowed to fall into decay by Henry VIII.   It is believed by some that the last person to have lived at the palace was Margaret Queen of Scots, sister of Henry VIII, who resided there after the death of her husband, James IV at the battle of Flodden Field. Another theory is that the church of St Mary Rouncival once stood in the area.   The Prior claimed a nearby farm possessed by a man Adam Scott, and 200 years later the will of the then owner Cecilie Kelly bequeathed to her daughter the land known as Scottes Ground.

The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the little remnant of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon. Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the four hundred women of Jabesh-gilead who were spared were given to them as wives.  But there were not enough women for all of them.  The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had left this gap in the tribes of Israel.  So the Israelite leaders asked, \"How can we find wives for the few who remain, since all the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?  There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel will not be lost forever.  But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse.\". .   . .     Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, between Lebonah and Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.  They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, \"Go and hide in the vineyards.  When the women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to be your wife!  And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be understanding.  Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find enough wives for them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not give your daughters in marriage to them.'\"  So the men of Benjamin did as they were told.  They kidnapped the women who took part in the celebration and carried them off to the land of their own inheritance.  Then they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.  So the assembly of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.. .  . .     Obviously these women were repeatedly raped.  These sick bastards killed and raped an entire town and then wanted more virgins, so they hid beside the road to kidnap and rape some more.

They attacked Midian just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.  All five of the Midianite kings \u2013 Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba \u2013 died in the battle.  They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.  Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder.  They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.  After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals, they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho. . .  . .     Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the people went to meet them outside the camp.

Representatives of many different academic disciplines have attempted to explain war.. [edit]. . Historical theories. . Historians tend to be reluctant to look for sweeping explanations for all wars. A. J. P. Taylor famously described wars as being like traffic accidents. There are some conditions and situations that make them more likely but there can be no system for predicting where and when each one will occur. Social scientists criticize this approach arguing that at the beginning of every war some leader makes a conscious decision and that they cannot be seen as purely accidental.. [edit]. . Psychological theories. . Psychologists such as E.F.M. Durban and John Bowlby have argued that human beings, especially men, are inherently violent. While this violence is repressed in normal society it needs the occasional outlet provided by war. This combines with other notions, such as displacement where a person transfers their grievances into bias and hatred against other ethnic groups, nations, or ideologies. While these theories can explain why wars occur, they do not explain when or how they occur. In addition, they raise the question why there are sometimes long periods of peace and other eras of unending war. If the innate psychology of the human mind is unchanging, these variations are inconsistent. A solution adopted to this problem by militarists such as Franz Alexander is that peace does not really exist. Periods that are seen as peaceful are actually periods of preparation for a later war or when war is suppressed by a state of great power, such as the Pax Britannica.. . If war is innate to human nature, as is presupposed by many psychological theories, then there is little hope of ever escaping it. One alternative is to argue that war is only, or almost only, a male activity and if human leadership was in female hands wars would not occur. This theory has played an important role in modern feminism. Critics, of course, point to various examples of female political leaders who had no qualms about using military force, such as Margaret Thatcher or Indira Gandhi.. . Other psychologists have argued that while human temperament allows wars to occur, they only do so when mentally unbalanced men are in control of a nation. This extreme school of thought argues leaders that seek war such as Napoleon, Hitler, and Stalin were mentally abnormal.. . A distinct branch of the psychological theories of war are the arguments based on evolutionary psychology. This school tends to see war as an extension of animal behaviour, such as territoriality and competition. However, while war has a natural cause, the development of technology has accelerated human destructiveness to a level that is irrational and damaging to the species. We have the same instincts of a chimpanzee but overwhelmingly more power. The earliest advocate of this theory was Konrad Lorenz. These theories have been criticized by scholars such as John G. Kennedy, who argue that the organized, sustained war of humans differs more than just technologically from the territorial fights between animals.. . In his fictional book Nineteen-Eighty-Four, George Orwell talks about war being used as one of many ways to distract people. War inspires fear and hate among the people of a nation, and gives them a 'legitimate' enemy upon whom they can focus this fear and hate. Thus the people are prevented from seeing that their true enemy is in fact their own repressive government. By this theory, war is another 'opiate of the masses' by which a totalitarian state controls its people and prevents revolution.. [edit]. . Anthropological theories. . Several anthropologists take a very different view of war. They see it as fundamentally cultural, learned by nurture rather than nature. Thus if human societies could be reformed, war would disappear.

But in integral we are to find out the area under the curve. So we first divide the curve into small divisions and then add their individual areas. Thus you see in the first one you limit the work area and in the second one you try to exond the work area slowly. Thus these being opposite the functions are opposite too!! .

In fact, if you want to get technical, here's another term for you: antiderivative. An integral is an antiderivate which is bounded. An antiderivative simply finds a function, integrals actually evaluate that function.. . To recap, I think that you are thinking \"how is a slope the inverse of an area?\" when really slopes and areas have nothing to do with one another. Those are just applications. Just remember that the process that you use to find the slope, and the process you use to find the area under the curve are inverse.", "17658_6": "I think you might have got the operations slightly confused in your question.

A type of camera in which the photographer looks through the actual taking lens when he or she peers through the viewfinder.. . Light entering an SLR camera lens hits a mirror installed in the body at a 45\u00b0 angle, which deflects the light up into the viewfinder pentaprism. When the photograph is actually taken the mirror flips up out of the way, the shutter opens and light strikes the surface of the film behind it. (the one exception being fixed pellicle mirror SLRs). . SLRs have a couple of very significant advantages. First, they do not suffer from parallax error, which makes them useful for closeup or macro photography. Second, what you see is mostly what you get - you can see the effects of filters, for example, before you take the photo. The image in an SLR viewfinder is also not reversed or upside-down, as is the case with TLRs and view cameras.. . There are also a number of disadvantages to SLRs. First, the pentaprism is bulky - it\u2019s the large hump on the top of an SLR. Second, the noise of the mirror slap means that SLRs are always much louder to operate than, say, rangefinders. Third, there is a brief mirror blackout period on most SLRs during which nothing can be seen in the viewfinder (fixed pellicle mirror SLRs being the one exception again). And finally, the mirror forms a physical barrier for the design of very wide-angle lenses, requiring inverted telephoto construction.\". .

For isoscleses triangle base angles always equal to (180 - (the top angle)) / 2 and then you have to add 180 that you neglected before to make the triangle, and that's how I got 180 + (180 - x)/2.

By relation, Jesus was born on December 25th because the jewish circumcision occcurs on the 8th day of life.", "3363720_2": "Why December 25? . For the church's first three centuries, Christmas wasn't in December\u2014or on the calendar at all.. . Elesha Coffman. . It's very tough for us North Americans to imagine Mary and Joseph trudging to Bethlehem in anything but, as Christina Rosetti memorably described it, \"the bleak mid-winter,\" surrounded by \"snow on snow on snow.\" To us, Christmas and December are inseparable. But for the first three centuries of Christianity, Christmas wasn't in December\u2014or on the calendar anywhere.. . If observed at all, the celebration of Christ's birth was usually lumped in with Epiphany (January 6), one of the church's earliest established feasts. Some church leaders even opposed the idea of a birth celebration. Origen (c.185-c.254) preached that it would be wrong to honor Christ in the same way Pharaoh and Herod were honored. Birthdays were for pagan gods.. . Not all of Origen's contemporaries agreed that Christ's birthday shouldn't be celebrated, and some began to speculate on the date (actual records were apparently long lost). Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215) favored May 20 but noted that others had argued for April 18, April 19, and May 28. Hippolytus (c.170-c.236) championed January 2. November 17, November 20, and March 25 all had backers as well. A Latin treatise written around 243 pegged March 21, because that was believed to be the date on which God created the sun. Polycarp (c.69-c.155) had followed the same line of reasoning to conclude that Christ's birth and baptism most likely occurred on Wednesday, because the sun was created on the fourth day.. . The eventual choice of December 25, made perhaps as early as 273, reflects a convergence of Origen's concern about pagan gods and the church's identification of God's son with the celestial sun. December 25 already hosted two other related festivals: natalis solis invicti (the Roman \"birth of the unconquered sun\"), and the birthday of Mithras, the Iranian \"Sun of Righteousness\" whose worship was popular with Roman soldiers. The winter solstice, another celebration of the sun, fell just a few days earlier. Seeing that pagans were already exalting deities with some parallels to the true deity, church leaders decided to commandeer the date and introduce a new festival.. . Western Christians first celebrated Christmas on December 25 in 336, after Emperor Constantine had declared Christianity the empire's favored religion. Eastern churches, however, held on to January 6 as the date for Christ's birth and his baptism. Most easterners eventually adopted December 25, celebrating Christ's birth on the earlier date and his baptism on the latter, but the Armenian church celebrates his birth on January 6. Incidentally, the Western church does celebrate Epiphany on January 6, but as the arrival date of the Magi rather than as the date of Christ's baptism.. . Another wrinkle was added in the sixteenth century when Pope Gregory devised a new calendar, which was unevenly adopted. The Eastern Orthodox and some Protestants retained the Julian calendar, which meant they celebrated Christmas 13 days later than their Gregorian counterparts. Most\u2014but not all\u2014of the Christian world now agrees on the Gregorian calendar and the December 25 date.. . The pagan origins of the Christmas date, as well as pagan origins for many Christmas customs (gift-giving and merrymaking from Roman Saturnalia; greenery, lights, and charity from the Roman New Year; Yule logs and various foods from Teutonic feasts), have always fueled arguments against the holiday. \"It's just paganism wrapped with a Christian bow,\" naysayers argue. But while kowtowing to worldliness must always be a concern for Christians, the church has generally viewed efforts to reshape culture\u2014including holidays\u2014positively.

There are no exact bounds to the visible spectrum; a typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm, although some people may be able to perceive wavelengths from 380 to 780 nm. A light-adapted eye typically has its maximum sensitivity at around 555 nm, in the green region of the optical spectrum (see: luminosity function). The spectrum does not, however, contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguish. Brown and pink are absent, for example. . . Color or colour [1] is the perception of the frequency (or wavelength) of light, and can be compared to how pitch (or a musical note) is the perception of the frequency or wavelength of sound.. . It is a perception that, in humans, derives from the ability of the fine structures of the eye to provide the brain with differently filtered analyses of a view (usually three). The perception of color is influenced by biology (some people are born seeing colors differently or not at all; see color blindness), long-term history of the observer, and also by short-term effects such as the colors nearby. (This is the basis of many optical illusions.). . The science of color is sometimes called chromatics. It includes the perception of color by the human eye, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art and the physics of color in the electromagnetic spectrum.", "4193050_0": "might help to ask around or search the name on the web. if u know this person u are searching for, it's also a good idea to join one of the network websites (like 360, myspace or friendster) coz u usually can get to any person from there.", "4193050_1": "Do a web-search on the person's name;. you ca do so by typing the name in this window, top right, in the box labelled \"Search the Web\".", "933612_0": "Hussein is a very common last name.

It aims at improving quality of life, by reducing or eliminating pain and other physical symptoms, enabling the patient to ease or resolve psychological and spiritual problems, and supporting the partner and family.. . The World Health Organisation (WHO), in a 1990 report on the topic, defined palliative care as \"the active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment\". This definition stresses the terminal nature of the disease. However, the term can also be used more generally to refer to anything that alleviates symptoms, even if there is also hope of a cure by other means; thus, a more recent WHO statement [1] calls palliative care \"an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness.\" In some cases, palliative treatments may be used to alleviate the side effects of curative treatments, such as relieving the nausea associated with chemotherapy.. . The term is not generally used with regard to a chronic disease such as diabetes which, although currently incurable, has treatments that are (ideally) effective enough that it is not considered a progressive or life-threatening disease in the same sense as cancer or progressive neurological conditions. It is, however, occasionally used with regard to some diseases, such as chronic, progressive pulmonary disorders and end stage renal disease or chronic heart failure.. . Though the concept of palliative care is not new, in the past most doctors have concentrated on aggressively trying to cure patients, so that concentrating on making a patient comfortable was seen as \"giving up\" on them. In recent times the concept of having a good quality of life has gained ground, although many would argue that there is a long way to go yet.

Ergonomics deals with the interaction of technological and work situations with the human being. The basic human sciences involved are anatomy, physiology  and psychology, these sciences are applied by the ergonomist towards two main objectives: the most productive use of human capabilities, and the maintenance of human health and well-being. In a phrase, the job must \u2018fit the person\u2019 in all respects, and the work situation should not compromise human capabilities and limitations.. . The contribution of basic anatomy lies in improving physical \u2018fit\u2019 between people and the things they use, ranging from hand tools to aircraft cockpit design. Achieving good physical fit is no mean feat when one considers the range in human body sizes across the population. The science of anthropometrics provides data on dimensions of the human body, in various postures. Biomechanics considers the operation of the muscles and limbs, and ensures that working postures are beneficial, and that excessive forces are avoided.. . Our knowledge of human physiology supports two main technical areas. Work physiology addresses the energy requirements of the body and sets standards for acceptable physical workrate and workload, and for nutrition requirements. Environmental physiology analyses the impact of physical working conditions \u2013 thermal, noise and vibration, and lighting \u2013 and sets the optimum requirements for these.. . Psychology is concerned with human information processing and decision-making capabilities. In simple terms, this can be seen as aiding the cognitive \u2018fit\u2019 between people and the things they use. Relevant topics are sensory processes, perception, long- and short-term memory, decision making and action. There is also a strong thread of organizational psychology.. . The importance of psychological dimensions of ergonomics should not be underestimated in today\u2019s \u2018high-tech\u2019 world \u2013 remember the video recorder example at the beginning.

At issue is to what does nine yards refer. The meaning is clearly the entirety or everything, but nine yards is not a significant measure of anything. All we know about its origin is that the phrase cannot be traced any earlier than the mid-1960s and that it is American in origin.. . Perhaps the most common assumption is that it is from American football, but the canonical distance in that game is ten, not nine, yards. Also common are explanations based on length of cloth, but there is no standard length for a bolt of cloth (which measure anywhere from twenty to twenty-five yards), and nine yards is not a significant measure for any type of garment (a man's suit uses about seven yards of a thirty-inch bolt, double folded; sarongs, saris, kilts, kimonos, bridal veils and any number of other garments have been suggested, none with any accompanying evidence).. . The explanation that is currently circulating around the internet most frequently is that nine yards was the length of a belt of machine gun ammunition carried by a WWII fighter plane. To \"give it the whole nine yards\" was to expend all of one's ammo. This explanation is almost certainly false. For one thing, the type of fighter varies with the teller, sometimes Spitfires in the Battle of Britain, sometimes varying American fighters in the South Pacific. Another reason to doubt it is that ammunition is either counted in rounds or by weight. It is never measured in length of a belt.

Automated order tracking and billing systems cut additional labor costs, and if the product or service can be downloaded, e-commerce firms have no distribution costs.

E-commerce also has some disadvantages, however. Consumers are reluctant to buy some products online.

When you're waving at somebody, your hand essentially acts as inverted pendelum.", "2866291_2": "An inverted pendulum is a physical device consisting in a cylinrical  bar (usually of alluminum) free to oscillate around a fixed pivot. The pivot is mounted on a carriage, which in its turn can move on a horizontal direction. . The carriage is driven by a motor, which can exert on it a variable force. . The bar would naturally tend to fall down from the top vertical position, which is a position of  unsteady equilibrium. . . The goal of the experiment is to stabilize the pendulum (bar) on the top vertical position. . This  is possible by exerting on the carriage through the motor a force which tends to contrast the 'free' pendulum dynamics. . The correct force has to be calculated measuring the instant values of the horizontal position and the pendulum angle (obtained e.g. through two potentiometers). . . The system pendulum+cart+motor can be modeled as a linear system if all the parameters are known (masses, lengths, etc.), in order to find a controller to stabilize it. If not all the parameters are known, one can however try to 'reconstruct' the system parameters using measured data on the dynamics of the pendulum. .   . . What is it used for?. The inverted pendulum is a traditional example ( neither difficult nor trivial) of a controlled system. . Thus it is used in simulations and experiments to show the performance of different controllers ( e.g. PID controllers, state space controllers, fuzzy controllers....). . The Real-Time Inverted Pendulum is used as a benchmark, to test the validity and the performance of the software underlying the state-space controller alogorithm, i.e. the used operating system. . Actually the algorithm is implement form the numerical point of view as a set of mutually co-operating tasks, which are periodically activated by the kernel, and which perform different calculations. . The way how these tasks are activated (e.g. the activation order) is calleding scheduling of the tasks. . It is obvious that a correct scheduling of each task is crucial for a good performance of the controller, and hence for an effective pendulum stabilization. . Thus the inverted pendulum is very useful in determing whether a particular schedulig choice is better than another one, in which cases, to which extent, and so on. . .

While this implies it is not Pagets since you state that it is above the nipple. . . However be safe for see a doctor and get it checked. This is not something to wait on. . . . PAGET'S DISEASE:. . Introduction:. Paget's disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer in which the first clinical finding is usually scaling of the nipple skin. It may also be associated with nipple redness and burning. The diagnosis of this condition is typically made with a skin biopsy, which shows cells typical of this condition (Paget's cells). The \"good news\" about Paget's disease is that it is usually a \"curable cancer\". However, most cases of scaling and burning of the nipple are due to benign conditions which can be easily confused with Paget's disease.. . Making the Diagnosis:. The major goal of this section is to help women (and their physicians) detect the early nipple changes associated with Paget's disease, and to help differentiate them from benign conditions. Making the diagnosis of Paget's disease is actually quite easy. We use a simple skin punch biopsy technique to remove a small piece of tissue from the area of the nipple with the abnormal changes. This procedure takes a few minutes to perform under local anesthesia and is painless. A small amount of skin and underlying tissues is removed and sent to the pathologist. In our experience with hundreds of cases it has proven to be 100% accurate. . . The first step in evaluating any patient with a change in the skin of the nipple is to obtain a careful history and to perform a careful breast examination, followed by a diagnostic mammogram. When performing a diagnostic mammogram the mammographer is informed about the posibility Paget's disease. Special films look for fine calcifications behind the nipple. If the mammogram is negative and our clinical suspicion is low, we usually suggest that the patient place a cortisone cream on the nipple for two weeks. . . If the condition has not responded completely to treatment in two weeks, we proceed to a skin punch biopsy. (a word of caution: we have seen cases of Paget's disease in which the mammogram was negative. The patient seemed to respond to treatment, but nipple changes recurred again in a few months. Therefore if a biopsy is not done, careful follow-up is recommended). Our rule of thumb: if in doubt, do a skin biopsy.", "1635724_1": "Sometimes you can't just by examining it.

The wistful, posthumous Minor Threat 7\" \"Salad Days\" comes out in 1984 and drives the final nail into the coffin of DC hardcore punk. Bands all over the country begin casting about for new things to do : DRI and Bad Brains start going cheeze-metal, New York bands start doing tough-guy mosh, 7Seconds goes jangly U2 alternative, etc. The prevailing change in D.C. is toward melodic rock with punk sensibilities.. . 1984 marks the release of Zen Arcade by Minneapolis band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, documenting their new mature sound combining furious, intense vocal delivery and driving guitars with slowed-down rockish tempos and more-complex, melodic songwriting.. . In spring 1984, a new band called Rites Of Spring forms from members of The Untouchables/Faith and Deadline. This band retains a punk speed and frenzy, but brings a totally new vocal approach to the mix. Singer Guy Picciotto keeps an out-of-breath punk style most of the time, at times delving into intensely personal lyrics dripping with emotion and sweat. His voice breaks down at climactic moments into a throaty, gravelly, passionate moan.. . The summer of 1985 becomes known as \"Revolution Summer\" when a new wave of rock-tempo, melody based, sung-vocal bands forms out of the DC punk musician pool with diverse rock sounds - Three, Gray Matter, Soulside, Ignition, Marginal Man, Fire Party, Rain, Shudder to Think, etc. Few bands retain the fast hardcore punk-based sound with the new vocal approach, Dag Nasty being the notable exception. . . Minor Threat's singer, Ian MacKaye's, sings for a band called Embrace (compare the band name to earlier DC bands Minor Threat, Void, and State Of Alert) whose lyrics are emotional and deeply self-questioning, but still clear and unambiguous. Musically, the group (formed mostly of ex-Faith members) writes midtempo, somewhat jangly music with a lot of pop guitar hooks. MacKaye's vocals retain his trademark bold enunciation, with only occasional sparks of emotive delivery.. . These bands' sound eventually becomes known as the classic \"D.C. sound.\" Some of it is derisively labeled \"emo,\" as shorthand for \"emotional.\" One account has this term first appearing in a Flipside interview with Ian MacKaye. Shortly thereafter DC bands aquire the tag \"emo-core.\" . . Slightly later (1986), some bands begin to focus on the \"emo\" element itself. The Hated in Annapolis (near D.C.) seem to be the first post-Rites of Spring to do this. Shortly thereafter, Moss Icon appears in in the same town. Moss Icon strips the \"emo\" element down to the core, and adds a great deal of intricate, arpeggiated guitar melody (by Tonie Joy, later of Born Against, Lava, Universal Order of Armageddon, etc.) with a strong focus on loud/soft dynamics. The vocals, too, break new ground by building up to actual top-of-the-lungs screaming at songs' climaxes. . . Moss Icon, as a relatively well-known band that toured some, introduces the punk scene to music that has core emphasis on emotion instead of punk energy. As such, I consider them the starting point for the emo movement, not Rites of Spring as is more commonly asserted.

You see, there are people who will answer your question by pointing out all the misfortunes in the city's history that goes back over a hundred years. The misfortunes they might include might be the decrepidation of Euclid Avenue, the departure of the Rockefellers and other industrialists from the area, urban sprawl, some terrible political corruption, pollution, racial issues, unsuccessful sport teams, the Cuyahoga river catching on fire, the loss of Fortune 500 companies BP America headquarters and TRW, the end of the Cleveland Ballet, brain drain, unemployment and poverty statistics.. . I don't know when this nickname originated, but it probably came about during the fire on the Cuyahoga in 1969 that made national headlines and was highly publicized. Though historians now look back on the incident as major media hype (who determined the fire was neither severe, ecologically damaging, nor unique to Cleveland), it was the source of great embarrassment and frustration for local Northeast Ohio residents who continue to believe Cleveland should be ashamed of itself. Since then, bad news and bad reputations always takes precedent over good news and good reputations in Cleveland. . . I think this title and more generally speaking the culture of negativity in Cleveland is based subconsciously on the fact that Cleveland was for a brief period of time the twenties the most  prosperous and prestigious city in perhaps the whole world and lost it practically over night. The \"mistake on the lake\" alludes to and replaced the former slogan of the city as \"the best location in the nation\". Cleveland's location as lying in the center of important crossroads as well as lying on Lake Erie and the terminus of the Ohio Erie Canal led to its prosperity. Look at a map and you will see Cleveland is the only big city between Cincinnati and Buffalo, Detroit and Pittsburg, and New York and Chicago. Before the Great Depression Cleveland was the sixth largest city in the country, claimed the most millionaires per capita in the world, was said to be the country's second most important international commercial center, had extremely exclusive stores and restaurants, and Euclid Avenue was considered the most beautiful street in the world.   . . Cleveland lost so much of its status when the Great Depression hit, and since then it has tried to reclaim its glory and rebuild itself but terrible things always kept happening. People have the feeling that the city's glory days were a fluke, and the city should have never been founded at all based on all kinds of bad news. The weather doesn't help either. There are so many reasons to be proud of the city, but most people aren\u2019t aware of any. I could go on and on and count these numerous reasons that give testament to the reality of Cleveland's first class status, but that isn't necessarily relative to your question.

Strabo (1.2.10) reports that in antiquity, the Black Sea was often just called \"the Sea\" (pontos), just like Homer was often simply called \"the Poet\". For the most part, Graeco-Roman tradition refers to the Black Sea as \u0395\u03cd\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 Euxeinos Pontos \"Hospitable sea\". This is a euphemism replacing an earlier Pontos Axeinos \"Inhospitable Sea\", first attested in Pindar (early 5th century BC). Strabo (7.3.6) thinks that the Black Sea was called \"inhospitable\" before Greek colonialization, because it was difficult to navigate, and because its shores were inhabited by savage tribes, and that the name was changed to \"hospitable\" after the Milesians had colonized, as it were making it part of the Greek civilization. It is, however, likely, that the name Axeinos arose by popular etymology, either from an Iranian axaina \"dark\", or from Ascanian, i.e. Phrygian. If from axaina \"dark\", the designation \"Black Sea\" would, after all, go back to Antiquity. The motive for the name may be an ancient assignment of colours to the direction of the compass, \"black\" referring to the north, and \"red\" referring to the south. Herodotus on one occasion uses Red Sea and \"Southern Sea\" interchangeably.. .

The remaining planets are deemed the outer planets.. . Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System. Mercury ranges from \u22120.4 to 5.5 in apparent magnitude, and its greatest angular separation from the Sun (greatest elongation) is only 28.3\u00b0, meaning it is only seen in twilight. The planet remains comparatively little-known: the only spacecraft to approach Mercury was Mariner 10 from 1974 to 1975, which mapped only 40\u201345% of the planet's surface.. . Physically, Mercury is similar in appearance to the Moon as it is heavily cratered. It has no natural satellites and no atmosphere. Nevertheless, the planet has a large iron core which generates a magnetic field about 1% as strong as that of the Earth. Surface temperatures on Mercury range from about 90-700 K, with the subsolar point being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the poles being the coldest.. . The Romans named the planet after the fleet-footed messenger god Mercury, probably for its fast apparent motion in the twilight sky. The astronomical symbol for Mercury (Unicode: \u263f) is a stylized version of the god's head and winged hat atop his caduceus. Before the 5th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects. The Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet as the water star, \u6c34\u661f, based on the Five Elements.. . Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is named after the Roman goddess Venus. A terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth's \"sister planet\", as the two are very similar in size and bulk composition. Although all planets' orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 1%. As Venus is closer to the Sun than the Earth, it always appears in roughly the same direction from Earth as the Sun (the greatest elongation is 47.8\u00b0), so on Earth it can usually only be seen a few hours before sunrise or a few hours after sunset. However, when at its brightest, Venus may be seen during the daytime, making it one of only two heavenly bodies that can be seen both day and night (the other being the Moon). It is sometimes referred to as the \"Morning Star\" or the \"Evening Star\", and when it is visible in dark skies it is by far the brightest star-like object in the sky.. . Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system, is named after the Roman god of war Mars (Ares in Greek mythology), because of its apparent red color. This feature also earned it the nickname \"The Red Planet\". Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and oddly-shaped, possibly being captured asteroids. The prefix areo- refers to Mars in the same way geo- refers to Earth\u2014for example, areology versus geology. (However, areology is also used to refer to the study of Mars as a whole rather than just the geological processes of the planet.). . The astronomical symbol for Mars is a circle with an arrow pointing northeast (Unicode: \u2642). This symbol is a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the god Mars, and in biology it is used as a sign for the male sex.. . The Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet as the fire star, \u706b\u661f, a naming based on the ancient Chinese mythological cycle of Five Elements.. .

The placenta and umbilical cord are the sources of oxygen and nutrients and the means of waste elimination.. .

In the third month, facial features continue to develop, nails form, ossification centers develop in bones, the sex of the unborn can be determined, and the fetus is capable of responding to outside stimulation. During the second trimester (fourth to sixth months), distinctive facial features develop, the fetal heartbeat can be detected, and fetal quickening (movements) can be felt externally. In the third trimester (the seventh to ninth months), the body proportions, except for the somewhat large head, are established, the skin becomes smoother, and the organs develop sufficiently for the newborn to function on its own.. . If the fetus is expelled before 36 weeks of gestation are completed, it often can survive outside the womb, but artificial assistance, such as intravenous feedings and strict maintainance of the ambient temperature, may be needed during the remainder of its normal developmental period.

It is famed as the subject of many UFO conspiracy theories.. Area 51 is a section of land of approximately 60 sq. mi. / 155 km\u00b2 in Lincoln County, Nevada, USA. It is part of the vast (4687 sq. mi. / 12139 km\u00b2) Nellis Air Force Range (NAFR). The area consists largely of the wide Emigrant Valley, framed by the Groom and Papoose mountain ranges (to the North and South respectively) and the Jumbled Hills to the East. Between the two ranges lies Groom Dry Lake (37\u00b016\u203205\u2033N, 115\u00b047\u203258\u2033W), a dry alkali lake bed roughly three miles (5 km) in diameter. A large air base exists on the southwest corner of the lake (37\u00b014\u2032N 115\u00b049\u2032W) with two concrete runways, one of which extends onto the lake bed, and four unprepared runways on the lake bed itself.. . High-resolution satellite images have shed some light on the facility's complex runway layouts. Area 51 has two operating runways, the main is 14L/32R, a concrete runway constructed in the 1990s, measuring 11,980 x 200 ft (3651 x 61 m) with a 1000 x 100 ft (304 x 30 m) overrun at each end and the secondary, shorter runway is 12/30 which also doubles as a taxiway, measuring 5,420ft x 150ft (1,652m x 45m). The much more enigmatic, older runway is exactly six miles (9656 m) long. It is composed of 12,500 ft of concrete, 11,080 ft of asphalt, and 5560 ft and 2540 ft of now dismantled asphalt on the north and south ends, respectively. At least three sets of old runway markings are found, suggesting that the full six-mile length was probably never used in its entirety. Currently only a 6,600 ft (2011 m) stretch of the concrete section is marked for use, forming runway 14R/32L. The dirt lakebed runways, comprising two twin airstrips, measure up to 11,270 ft (3435 m) in length and 100 to 170 ft (30 to 52 m) in width.. . Area 51 shares a border with the Yucca Flats region of the Nevada Test Site (NTS), the location of many of the U.S. Department of Energy's nuclear weapons tests. The Yucca Mountain nuclear storage facility is approximately 40 miles (64km) southwest of Groom Lake.. . The designation \"Area 51\" is somewhat contentious, appearing on older maps of the NTS but not newer ones, but the same naming scheme is used for other parts of the Nevada Test Site.. . The area is connected to the internal NTS road network, with paved roads leading both to Mercury to the northwest and west to Yucca Flats. Leading northeast from the lake, Groom Lake Road (a wide, well-conditioned dirt road) runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. Groom Lake Road was formerly the track leading to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course takes it past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east than this (unauthorized visitors who travel west on Groom Lake Road are usually observed first by guards located on the hills surrounding the pass, still several miles from the checkpoint). After leaving the restricted area (marked by numerous warning signs stating that \"photography is prohibited\" and that \"use of deadly force is authorized\") Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the Tikaboo Valley, passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before joining with Nevada State Route 375, the \"Extraterrestrial Highway\", south of Rachel.", "660126_0": "For the past two thousand years the Ramayana has been among the most important literary and oral texts of South Asia.

Stephen Barrett, M.D.. Cellulite is a term coined in European salons and spas to describe deposits of dimpled fat found on the thighs and buttocks of many women. Widespread promotion of the concept in the United States followed the 1973 publication of Cellulite: Those Lumps, Bumps and Bulges You Couldn't Lose Before, by Nicole Ronsard, owner of a New York City beauty salon that specialized in skin and body care. Cellulite is alleged to be a special type of \"fat gone wrong,\" a combination of fat, water, and \"toxic wastes\" that the body has failed to eliminate. Alleged \"anticellulite\" products sold through retail outlets, by mail, through multilevel companies, and through the Internet have included \"loofah\" sponges; cactus fibers; special washcloths; horsehair mitts; creams [A, B, C] and gels to \"dissolve\" cellulite; supplements containing vitamins; minerals and/or herbs [A, B, C]; bath liquids; massagers [A, B]; rubberized pants; exercise books; brushes; rollers; body wraps; and toning lotions. Many salons offer treatment with electrical muscle stimulation, vibrating machines, inflatable hip-high pressurized boots, \"hormone\" or \"enzyme\" injections, heating pads, and massage. Some operators claim that 5 to 15 inches can be lost in one hour. A series of treatments can cost hundreds of dollars.. . \"Cellulite\" is not a medical term. Medical authorities agree that cellulite is simply ordinary fatty tissue [1]. Strands of fibrous tissue connect the skin to deeper tissue layers and also separate compartments that contain fat cells. When fat cells increase in size, these compartments bulge and produce a waffled appearance of the skin. Many years ago, Neil Solomon, M.D., conducted a double-blind study of 100 people to see whether cellulite differed from ordinary fat. Specimens of regular fat and lumpy fat were obtained by a needle biopsy procedure and given to pathologists for analysis and comparison. No difference between the two was found.. . More recently, researchers at Rockefeller Institute used ultrasonography, microscopic examinations, and fat-metabolism studies to see \"affected\" and unaffected skin areas differed in seven healthy adult subjects (five women, two men; four affected, three unaffected). The researchers concluded: (a) certain characteristics of skin make women more prone than men to develop cellulite; (b) the process is diffuse rather than localized; and (3) there were no significant differences in the appearance or function of the fatty tissue or the regional blood flow between affected and unaffected sites within individuals [2].. . Electrical Muscle Stimulators (EMS) and Iontophoresis Devices. Muscle stimulators are a legitimate medical device approved for certain conditions -- to relax muscle spasms, increase blood circulation, prevent blood clots, and rehabilitate muscle function after a stroke. But many health spas and figure salons claim that muscle stimulators can remove wrinkles, perform face lifts, reduce breast size, reduce a \"beer belly,\" and remove cellulite. Iontophoresis devices are prescription devices that use direct electric current to introduce ions of soluble salts (i.e., medications) into body tissues for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. The only approved use is for diagnosing cystic fibrosis.. . The FDA considers promotion of muscle stimulators or iontophoresis devices for any type of body shaping or contouring to be fraudulent [3,4]. The most infamous of these devices, the Relax-A-Cizor, was claimed to reduce girth by delivering electric shocks to the muscles. More than 400,000 units were sold for $200 to $400 each before the FDA obtained an injunction in 1970 to stop its sale. At the trial, 40 witnesses testified that they had been injured while using the machine.

Such as the bellow:. \u201cNike\u201d \u201c\u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u201c(used for girls exactly as the Latin \"Victoria\"). \u201cAniketos\u201d \u201c\u0391\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\u201d meaning unbeaten. \"Nikator\" a name used by the ancient  Macedonian(Greek) Kings meaning winner, victorious!. \u201cNicholaos\u201d, (a very famous Greek name) meaning \"Victory of the people\". (\u201cNicholaos\u201d can be found as \u201cNicholas\u201d, \u201cNikos\u201d, \u201cNick\u201d, and \u201cClaus\u201d). And \u201cNikitas\u201d (medieval/modern Greek) which means \u201cwinner\u201d. . (\u201cNikitas\u201d is only a male name but it was used (mainly by the Slavs) as \u201cNikita\u201d for both male and females. That\u2019s why you have a female character named \u201cNikita\u201d.

Slim", "1021881_1": "Boy, are you mixed up! I read your other questions, so I don't know if you think well enough or know English well enough to understand this, but here goes! God's nature is love. For love to be love there has to be something or someone to love. The reason that God created both angels and humans is so that He would have someone to love and to love Him in return. Also, if humans love each other as well as love God, the love is multiplied. That is why when Jesus was asked, What is the greatest commandment? He answered, \"To love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your mind and all your strentgh. And the 2nd is like unto it, to love your neighbor as yourself.\".    Now, here is where problems came in. The nature of love is that it can't be commanded. If God created us so that we had to love Him - that we had no choice - then, that wouldn't be love. Love has to be a choice. That is one of the reasons why God gave us free choice, so that we could choose to love Him..    God did not create Satan. Satan's original name was Lucifer,. which means, the light bringer (or bearer). Lucifer was the smartest and the most powerful angel that God created. But Lucifer and the other angels were also given freewill so that they could choose to love God. Lucifer, became full of pride at being the smartest and the most powerful angel and chose to not love God and to not obey God. He wanted to be God himself! Satan convinced 1/3rd of the angels to follow him instead of God and for this they were kicked out of Heaven. This is also why that after Jesus's 2nd coming Satan and the angels that followed him will be cast into hell and never let out. .   Now, as you can immagine, Satan is very angry about this. He knows that he is going to hell and also that God doesn't  want any human to go to hell. Satan wants to cause as many humans to go to hell as possible. His main weapon is lies. At the time that Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden they had only one commandment they had to obey. Only one, can you immagine it.. God told them to \"not eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\", and if they did, that they would die. Satan lied to Eve and said that God lied to her. That if she ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge she would be like God and be able to tell good from evil and that she wouldn't die. Satan said God lied about her dying if she ate that fruit (it wasn't an apple!) because God didn't love her and Adam and have their best interest at heart. Too bad that Adam believed Eve instead of God and here we are. Adam and Eve got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, they did die, and all of us will die too, at least our bodies will..    Satan is still telling the same lies today. He says that God doesn't love us and that the rules he gave us in the Bible are not in our best interest. An earlier person who answered your question said that freewill meant that we could do what we want and accept the consequences. Well, God said the consequenses of sin are pain in this life, death, and everlasting suffering in hell. Since those are the consequenses of sin, I will choose to the best of my ability, not to do what I want if it is a sin but what God wants and tells us in the Bible. I think to choose anything else is stupid! Remember, Satan is a lier and God really does love us.
